## Introduction
 This game is designed to spread awareness about the importance of health education and promote healthy living. By playing this game, players will not only have fun but also gain valuable knowledge about different diseases, which can help them make informed decisions about their health. By combining interactive gameplay with educational content, we strive to make learning about health both fun and impactful.
## Social Cause
The social cause behind this game is to educate people about various diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. Many people lack awareness about the symptoms, causes, and treatment options for these diseases, which can lead to delayed diagnosis, misdiagnosis, or even death. By creating a game that teaches players about these diseases in an engaging and interactive way, we hope to empower individuals to take control of their health and make informed decisions.

## Game Overview
The game begins with a simple interface featuring two primary options: "Play" and "Exit." Upon selecting "Play," the player is presented with a new window showcasing eight buttons, each representing a different disease. For instance, selecting the button labeled "AIDS" initiates the game focused on Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

### Gameplay Mechanics
The game is designed as a platformer, where the player navigates through levels while combating virus cells, represented as enemies. The player is equipped with a gun and grenades to eliminate these enemy cells. The enemies, in turn, fight back, making the gameplay challenging and engaging. The player's health decreases when hit by enemy cells, adding a layer of strategy to the game.

### Educational Elements
To integrate educational content seamlessly into the gameplay, each level contains six mystery boxes. These boxes, when collected, provide the player with crucial information points about the selected disease. For example, in the AIDS level, these points may include facts about the transmission of HIV, symptoms of AIDS, diagnostic methods, available treatments, and preventive measures.

### Quiz and Progression
At the end of each level, the player must answer a quiz question related to the disease. This quiz serves as a checkpoint to ensure that the player has assimilated the information provided during the level. A correct answer allows the player to progress to the next level, which presents new fact points and a new quiz question. Each disease is covered in five progressively challenging levels, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the topic.

### Level Design
Each disease is covered across five levels, each with unique layouts, enemies, and educational content.As the player progresses, levels become more challenging, requiring better strategy and understanding of the disease to succeed.New fact points are introduced in each level, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the disease by the end of the game.
